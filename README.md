# Customer-Churn

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis of customer churn using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors leading to customer churn and build predictive models to minimize attrition.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes various customer attributes such as:

Demographics: Gender, senior citizen status, etc.
Subscription Details: Contract type, payment method, tenure, internet service, etc.
Usage & Billing Information: Monthly charges, total charges, payment type.
Churn Status: Whether the customer has churned or not.

## Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, selecting relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of customer behavior, churn trends, and key 
                                 influencing factors.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing various classification models such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
